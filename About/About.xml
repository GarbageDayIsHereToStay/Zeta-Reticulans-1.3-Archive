  <description>(Newest patch notes on workshop; Release Version: 18-05-2023, small update to make xenotype playable)
\nCold and mechanical Zeta Reticulans are unaffected by most human emotions. Their frustrations mostly stem from whether work standards are being kept and mission guidelines followed; Their greatest joy is working in their field of expertise.
